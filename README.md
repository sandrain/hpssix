# HPSSIX: HPSS Metadata Indexing

HPSSIX incrementally indexes metadata of files in running HPSS system and
allows users to quickly locate files of interest with file metadata, including
POSIX file attributes (or stat metadata) and POSIX extended attributes. HPSSIX
also features the fulltext search for supported file types, e.g., Microsoft
Office document files.
